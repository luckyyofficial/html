# 🌐 Introduction to HTML

HTML (**HyperText Markup Language**) is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web. It tells the browser **what each part of a webpage is** — whether it's a heading, a paragraph, an image, or a link.

### 🔎 Key Points:
- HTML uses **tags** (like `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<img>`) to define elements.
- It's the **foundation** of every webpage.
- Works hand-in-hand with **CSS** (for styling) and **JavaScript** (for interactivity).
- HTML is **not a programming language** — it's a **markup language**.

### 📘 Example:
```html
<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
